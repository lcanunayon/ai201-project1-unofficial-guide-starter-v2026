"""
Stage 2 of the pipeline: splitting documents into chunks.

⚠️ THIS IS THE FILE YOU CHANGE IN MILESTONE 3.

`split_documents` below is deliberately plain. It cuts every document into
fixed-size pieces with a fixed overlap and pays no attention to where sentences
or paragraphs end. It works, and it is not good.

On a corpus of short posts it may not cut anything at all: `campus_life` comes
out as 88 documents and 88 chunks, because almost nothing in it reaches 800
characters. That is the baseline, not a bug — Milestone 3 is where you decide
whether one post should stay one chunk.

Your job in Milestone 3 is to replace the *body* of `split_documents` with a
strategy that fits the documents you actually read in Milestone 1. Keep the
name and the shape of what it returns — the rest of the pipeline calls it, and
your README has to name the function that produced your chunks.

If you get stuck for 30 minutes, `fallback_split` is the original. Switch back
to it, write down what you saw, and move on. That's a real observation about
your pipeline, not giving up.

    Split on paragraph breaks instead of a fixed character count.

    campus_life documents are short (317 characters on average, longest 563 —
    nothing reaches the old 800-character window, which is why the starter
    never split anything). But most of them aren't one thought: counting
    paragraphs across the corpus, 56 of 88 documents are a title plus exactly
    two body paragraphs, and course/housing pages run to three or four. Each
    body paragraph reliably carries one self-contained idea — a course page
    separates format/assessment from workload from advice; a noise page
    separates the actual noise fact from "go to the library instead"; a
    dining page separates the experience (wait times, what's good) from the
    logistics (hours, cost). A document with only one paragraph after its
    title stays a single chunk, which is most of them and matches what the
    starter already did by accident.

    The title is carried into every piece, because a chunk like "The bad: the
    heating is uneven" means nothing without knowing which building it's
    about, and the chunk text itself never repeats the building name.
